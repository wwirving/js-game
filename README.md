Object Cloud is a browser based game built using Javascript, HTML and CSS. 

The game is built using HTML canvas and a class orientated approach to game mechanics and design. Each object (sourced from gifs by ac-bu studio) has uniquely generated parameters and exists in an audio visual feedback-loop which increases throughout the game. The audio events for the game are handled by Howler.JS and then processed globally through Tuna.JS, allowing global control of reverb and delay. Visual feedback is then modulated by increasing the canvas-refresh time within the animation loop. Game audio was synthesised and recorded in Ableton Live, with gamelan samples sourced from the Omnisphere library. The main character and design of the game were generated in Figma. The font used is Overwatch. Though designed to be played on desktop, the game also scales well to mobile and can be played continously between mobile and portrait modes.
